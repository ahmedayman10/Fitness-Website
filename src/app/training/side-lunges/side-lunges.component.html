    <p>The lunge is a popular leg-strengthening exercise with a multitude of variations to add variety to your workout. In addition, varying your technique allows you to emphasize different muscles or parts of those muscles.

      This exercise is beneficial for injury prevention, as well as rehabilitation after injuries occur. Itâ€™s often part of a foundational strength program or rehab protocol, allowing athletes and exercisers to return to their sport or activity of interest as quickly as possible.</p>
